# Timestamp Microservice

This is an example of a microservice built with nodejs and express. The project is based of one of the [FreeCodeCamp back-end final projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) and is composed of an express server hosting a default index page at root and `/api/` routes that respond with json objects showing dates in UTC and unix format based on the request being made..

Live version of the microservice can be found [here.](https://timestamp-microservice-12.herokuapp.com/)
